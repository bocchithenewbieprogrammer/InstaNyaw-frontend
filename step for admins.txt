❌ 1. No Content Moderation routes yet

You do NOT have:

hide post

unhide post

admin delete ANY post

admin edit ANY post (content manager)

These must be created for:

HomePost

BirthdayGreeting

Announcement

SchoolNews

LostAndFound

❌ 2. No Department-limited filtering

Sub-admins must only manage:

their department users

their department posts

Your protect middleware gives department data,
but adminController.js does NOT use department for filtering yet.

❌ 3. No Analytics Endpoints Yet

Your dashboard needs:

totalUsers

totalPosts

totalComments

totalLikes

postsPerDepartment

topPost

activityLog

postsPerDay

NONE of these routes exist yet.

❌ 4. No Hidden Post System Yet

Your post models still lack:

hidden: Boolean


Admin cannot hide/unhide posts until this exists system-wide.

❌ 5. No Dashboard Frontend Bindings

Your admin dashboard frontend will need:

JS functions to load metrics

JS functions to load users list

JS for ban/unban buttons

JS for hide/unhide buttons

JS filtering by role / department

Right now, there are no JS APIs connected.
